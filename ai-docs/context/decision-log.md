**Rationale**:
- Eliminates long-lived credentials
- Better security posture
- Industry best practice
- GitHub Actions native support

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Improved security
- ✅ No credential rotation needed
- ✅ Better audit trail

- ❌ GitHub Environment context issues

## ADR-005: LocalStack for Integration Testing
**Date**: September 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need reliable integration testing without AWS costs  
**Decision**: Use LocalStack for local AWS service emulation  
**Rationale**:
- Cost-effective testing
- Faster test execution
- No AWS dependencies
- Consistent test environment

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Reduced testing costs
- ✅ Faster test execution
- ✅ Reliable test environment
- ❌ Not 100% AWS compatible
- ❌ Additional complexity

## ADR-006: Direct AWS CLI for OIDC
**Date**: September 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: GitHub Actions OIDC integration issues  
**Decision**: Use direct AWS CLI calls instead of aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials  
**Rationale**:
- More reliable OIDC authentication
- Better error handling
- Avoids GitHub Action limitations
- More control over credential flow

**Consequences**:
- ✅ More reliable authentication
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ More control
- ❌ More verbose workflow code
- ❌ Manual credential management

## ADR-007: EC2-Based Dev Environment
**Date**: September 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need cost-effective development environment  
**Decision**: Use EC2 instances for development API instead of API Gateway  
**Rationale**:
- Cost-effective for development
- Easier debugging
- More control over environment
- Simpler monitoring

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Cost-effective development
- ✅ Easier debugging
- ✅ More control
- ❌ Not serverless
- ❌ Manual scaling

## ADR-008: Context-Aware Documentation System
**Date**: September 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need comprehensive documentation for AI agents and humans  
**Decision**: Implement dual-layer documentation system (AI + Human)  
**Rationale**:
- Different needs for AI vs human users
- Better context preservation
- Living documentation
- Improved maintainability

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Better context preservation
- ✅ Tailored documentation
- ✅ Living updates
- ❌ Additional maintenance
- ❌ More complex structure

## ADR-009: Multi-Environment Deployment Strategy
**Date**: September 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need comprehensive environment strategy for development, testing, and production  
**Decision**: Implement 5-environment deployment strategy  
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Gradual promotion from local to production
- Risk mitigation through staging
- Better developer experience
- Production safety through isolation

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Clear environment separation
- ✅ Gradual promotion flow
- ✅ Risk mitigation
- ✅ Better developer experience
- ❌ Increased complexity
- ❌ Higher operational overhead

## ADR-010: Environment Promotion Automation
**Date**: September 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need automated promotion between environments  
**Decision**: Implement automated promotion scripts with validation gates  
**Rationale**:
- Reduce human error
- Ensure consistency
