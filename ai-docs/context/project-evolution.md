# SoundBite Project Evolution Timeline

## Project Overview
**SoundBite** is a serverless audio processing platform built on AWS, designed for high-performance audio file processing with idempotency guarantees and comprehensive security features.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Architecture (January 2025)
- **Project Initiation**: Core system design and CDK infrastructure setup
- **Key Decisions**:
  - AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
  - Serverless architecture (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3)
  - TypeScript for both infrastructure and application code
  - Yarn 4 for package management

### Phase 2: Feature Implementation (Q1-Q2 2025)
- **Core Features**:
  - Idempotency system implementation
  - Security enhancements and validation
  - Audio processing pipeline
  - User authentication and authorization
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Idempotency keys for duplicate request prevention
  - JWT-based authentication
  - S3-based audio storage with lifecycle policies

### Phase 3: CI/CD Evolution (September 2025)
- **Major Improvements**:
  - OIDC (OpenID Connect) implementation for keyless deployments
  - LocalStack integration for integration tests
  - GitHub Actions workflow optimization
  - Docker containerization improvements
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Replaced long-lived AWS keys with OIDC
  - Implemented LocalStack for local AWS service testing
  - Direct AWS CLI approach for OIDC authentication

### Phase 4: Documentation Maturation (September 2025)
- **Documentation Overhaul**:
  - Comprehensive CI/CD documentation
  - OIDC setup and troubleshooting guides
  - Context-aware memory system implementation
  - Dual-layer documentation architecture

## Current State (September 2025)
- **Infrastructure**: Fully deployed on AWS with OIDC authentication
- **CI/CD**: Three working pipelines (CI, Deploy dev, CI/CD Pipeline)
- **Monitoring**: EC2-based health checks and CloudWatch integration
- **Documentation**: Transitioning to context-aware memory system

## Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Serverless First**: All components designed for serverless operation
2. **Idempotency by Design**: Built-in duplicate request prevention
3. **Security First**: Comprehensive security validation and monitoring
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete CDK-based infrastructure management
5. **Keyless Deployments**: OIDC-based CI/CD without long-lived credentials

## Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js 22
- **Package Manager**: Yarn 4.9.4
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK (TypeScript)
- **Compute**: AWS Lambda, EC2
- **Storage**: S3, DynamoDB
- **Messaging**: SQS
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, Custom health checks
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with OIDC
- **Testing**: Jest, LocalStack
