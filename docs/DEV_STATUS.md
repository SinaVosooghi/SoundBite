# SoundBite Development Status

## Project Overview
SoundBite is a TypeScript/NestJS audio service that converts text to MP3 "soundbites" using AWS Polly. The project has a functional core pipeline but several areas still need implementation or refinement.

## Current Status
The project is in active development with:

### Implemented Components
- Basic NestJS API with TypeScript strict mode
- Core endpoints for creating and retrieving soundbites
- Lambda processor for text-to-speech conversion
- AWS infrastructure (DynamoDB, S3, SQS, Lambda)
- Basic CDK stacks for infrastructure deployment
- Docker configuration for local development
- LocalStack integration for AWS service emulation

### Partially Implemented
- Security middleware (helmet with basic CSP)
- Error handling with custom exceptions
- Idempotency middleware and decorators
- Testing framework setup

### Needs Implementation
- Comprehensive validation logic
- Cache provider interface for idempotency
- Improved error handling with RFC 7807
- Rate limiting for security endpoints
- Content-Security-Policy refinement
- Enhanced API documentation
- Cache cleanup mechanism
- CI/CD pipeline improvements

## Current Development Tasks
1. Add @Injectable() decorator to SecurityMiddleware
2. Create CacheProvider interface for idempotency
3. Extract validation logic to separate service
4. Simplify error handling logic
5. Create constants file for magic strings
6. Enhance API documentation
7. Improve cache cleanup mechanism
8. Add rate limiting to security reporting endpoints
9. Implement Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only for staging
10. Improve validation error parsing

## Architecture
```
Client → (REST) NestJS API → SQS Queue → Lambda Processor → Polly → S3 (MP3)
                                         ↘ DynamoDB (job/status metadata)
```

## Next Steps
1. Complete the current development tasks
2. Implement comprehensive testing
3. Refine security features
4. Improve error handling
5. Enhance documentation
6. Set up CI/CD pipeline
7. Prepare for production deployment
